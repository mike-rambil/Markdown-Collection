# ReleaseTag

The snippet you've shared is typically used for displaying the version information and the latest release of a project hosted on GitHub.

- **[Release Tag](./contents/ReleaseTag.md#note)**: This is a markdown link that probably points to a section in your project documentation where you describe release tags, which are labels for specific points in the project's version history. Release tags are commonly used to mark stable versions or important milestones of a project.

- **![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/test/test)**: This is an image badge that dynamically shows the latest release version of the project from GitHub. It pulls the version number from the project's GitHub releases and displays it on the readme or documentation. The badge will update automatically when a new release is made.

Together, these are used to provide users with quick access to the project's release version and related documentation.
